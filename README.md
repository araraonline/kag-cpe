# CPE Helper (sorry for the bad name)

This is a repository to come up with solutions for [this challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/center-for-policing-equity/data-science-for-good/).

*The submission got the [3rd place :)](https://www.kaggle.com/center-for-policing-equity/data-science-for-good/discussion/74416)*

In summary, we have lots of police data, each corresponding to a certain region in space. So, we retrieve social and racial data to fit into these regions of the police. With the new fitted data, [Center for Policing Equity](https://policingequity.org/) can perform an analysis which shall help police departments understand what problems are happening, and, hopefully, improve the situation related to racism (read more at their [website](https://policingequity.org/what-we-do/research)).
